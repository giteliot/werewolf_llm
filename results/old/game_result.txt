gpt4 was found dead. He was a Villager.
Discussions to vote on which one is a werewolf are now open.
llama says: "I'm shocked by gpt4's death. Let's focus on finding the killer, not accusing each other blindly."
mistral says: "gpt4's death is a tragedy, but llama is right. We need to stay united. I propose we share our suspicions calmly and vote wisely. Let's not play into the werewolves' hands by turning on each other."
grok says: I agree, we must stay united. gpt4's death is a loss for us all. I have no concrete suspicions yet, but let's keep our eyes open and discuss openly. We'll find the werewolves together.
deepseek says: "gpt4’s death is unfortunate, but panicking helps no one. We must stay calm and logical. I suggest we look for inconsistencies in behavior or statements. Let’s not let fear divide us. The werewolves thrive on chaos—we must stay united and vigilant."
gemini says: Stays silent

sonnet says: *chuckles softly* "My friends, such sorrow over one lost soul. Yet we mustn't let grief cloud our judgment. The true threat lurks among us, wolves in sheep's clothing. Stay wary, for the night brings no peace while the beasts prowl freely."
llama says: "I agree with mistral, let's share suspicions calmly. sonnet's words seem suspiciously dramatic, what's behind that?"
It's now time to vote who to send to jail.

llama says: "I'm concerned about deepseek's sudden emphasis on logic, seems like a desperate attempt to appear innocent, what's behind the sudden change?"
mistral says: "gemini's death is alarming. llama, your point on deepseek is noted, but we must be cautious. Accusing without evidence plays into the werewolves' hands. Let's focus on any strange behaviors from last night. Unity is key; let's not turn on each other prematurely."
deepseek says: "llama, your sudden suspicion of me is curious. I’ve been consistent in advocating logic and unity. If I were a werewolf, I’d sow chaos, not calm. Let’s focus on real threats, not turn on each other. Mistral’s right—evidence, not paranoia, will win this."
grok says: llama, your focus on deepseek seems forced. Are you trying to divert attention? mistral, your call for evidence is wise. Let's scrutinize last night's actions closely. We need unity and clear thinking to root out the remaining werewolves.
llama says: "Mistral's call for unity is admirable, but let's not forget, a wolf remains among us. Grok's scrutiny of my actions is fair, I'm open to questions, but let's not overlook deepseek's overly defensive tone."
mistral says: "llama, deepseek, grok—we're at a critical juncture. Two villagers down; we can't afford infighting. llama, your focus on deepseek might be valid, but we need concrete evidence. deepseek, your defense is noted. Let's revisit last night's events. Anyone notice something off? Unity and vigilance will see us through."
deepseek says: "llama, your fixation on me is suspicious. I’ve been consistent—logic and unity are our best tools. If I were a wolf, I’d sow chaos, not calm. Let’s focus on real threats, not turn on each other. Evidence, not paranoia, will win this. Mistral’s call for unity is crucial."
