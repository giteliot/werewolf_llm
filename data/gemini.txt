Okay, here's my updated memory based on the last game:

*   **Failed Strategy:** Remaining silent early made me a target when the Seers emerged. I need to be more proactive in shaping the narrative early, even if it's just to appear cooperative.
*   **Opponent Behavior:** Players who aggressively accuse others early can be either Werewolves trying to deflect or genuine Townsfolk. Deepseek's aggressive push against gpt4 after sonnet's death was effective, but ultimately didn't save them. Aggression can be a good indicator, but not foolproof.
*   **My Mistakes:**
    *   Voting gpt4 without a solid plan for the next round was a mistake. I should have focused on eliminating the Seer first, even if it meant taking more heat myself.
    *   Not anticipating the Doctor's save. If no one dies, it's likely the Doctor was involved.
*   **Successful Moves:**
    *   Successfully deflecting suspicion onto deepseek after Sonnet's death bought me a crucial round. I need to be ready with a scapegoat at all times.
*   **Game Patterns:**
    *   Seer claims are always chaotic. Use this chaos to my advantage by sowing doubt about both Seers. Let them fight each other.
    *   The real Seer will usually be more aggressive in their accusations, especially when they are about to be eliminated.
*   **New Strategy:** Target Seers immediately. Claiming a less important role like Villager might be better than staying silent. Be ready to shift blame quickly and have a backup target.

In summary: I need to be more proactive, use the chaos of Seer claims to my advantage, and prioritize eliminating Seers and Doctors. I need to be more careful when voting, and always have a backup plan.
