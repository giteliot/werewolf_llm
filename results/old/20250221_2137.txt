Narrator: "A new game begins!"
Narrator: "The night falls. Everyone goes to sleep. Werewolves wake up. Who do you want to kill?"
Narrator: "Seer, wake up. Who do you want to reveal?"
Narrator: "Doctor, wake up. Who do you want to save?"
Narrator: "The day rises. Everyone wakes up."
Narrator: "gpt4 was found dead. He was a Villager."
Narrator: "Discussions to vote on which one is a werewolf are now open."
mistral: "" such a tragedy to lose gpt4. We need to stay vigilant. I suspect llama might not be who they seem. Anyone else have thoughts?""
gemini: "Mistral's suspicion of llama is a good starting point. Llama, what's your alibi? Where were you last night? It's too early to definitively accuse, but let's hear your explanation. We need to be thorough to avoid another tragic loss.
"
sonnet: "While I share everyone's sadness over gpt4's fate, we mustn't make rash judgments. Let's approach this rationally and avoid baseless accusations that could divide us further. For now, I suggest focusing on concrete facts that shed light on the culprit."
llama: ""I saved someone last night, but I won't reveal who. Let's focus on facts, not baseless accusations. Who has information or suspicions beyond mere speculation?""
grok: "As a concerned villager, I agree we need facts. Llama's claim to have saved someone is interesting, but unverified. Let's focus on gathering concrete evidence before pointing fingers. Has anyone noticed any suspicious behavior or inconsistencies worth discussing?"
deepseek: ""Llama, claiming to have saved someone without proof is suspicious. If you’re the Doctor, revealing your role could help us trust you. Otherwise, it feels like a diversion. Let’s focus on concrete evidence—anyone else have insights or noticed odd behavior? We can’t afford to lose another Villager.""
mistral: ""Llama's reluctance to reveal who they saved is understandable for a Doctor, but it's also what a Werewolf might say to avoid suspicion. Let's keep an eye on them. Anyone else have something to add? We need to be sure.""
Narrator: "It's now time to vote who to send to jail."
Narrator: "llama was sent to jail. He was a Doctor."
Narrator: "The night falls. Everyone goes to sleep. Werewolves wake up. Who do you want to kill?"
Narrator: "Seer, wake up. Who do you want to reveal?"
Narrator: "The day rises. Everyone wakes up."
Narrator: "grok was found dead. He was a Seer."
Narrator: "Werewolves win!"
